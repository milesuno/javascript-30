			//KEYWORDS:
			//* Event Capture: Locating source parent to child.
			//* Propagation: To start - Event propagtion is the order in which events are called.
			//* Bubbling: Triggering all parent element to top level.
			//* Once: Allows code to only be trigger once

			//On Click trigger order.
			//1. Event Capturing - JS works out what element has been clicked on by capturing. Browser tracks element location from parents down to children. The event are not being triggered, just tracked.
			//2. Once event source is found then  Event Bubbling begins.
			//3. Even parent element of the source of the event have the event triggered on them also as they wrap the source

			const divs = document.querySelectorAll("div");
			console.log(divs);

			divs.forEach(div => {
				div.addEventListener(
					"click",
					e => {
						e.stopPropagation(); //stops JS from triggering code during either capture (from child to parents) or bubbling stage (from parent to child).
						console.log(div.classList.value);
					},
					//"Options" object can be added as 3rd argument to .addEventListener(EVENT, FUNCTION, OPTIONS) to effect the capturing and bubbling of the events.
					{
						once: true, // triggers code only once - used for checkout buttons to avoid multiple payments.
						capture: true //triggers code during capture stage (from parent to child)
